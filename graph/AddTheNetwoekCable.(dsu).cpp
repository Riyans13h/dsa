// Q. Count the number of Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a directed graph using Kosaraju's algorithm.
//
// A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between any two vertices. 
// Kosaraju's algorithm finds all strongly connected components in a graph using 3 main steps:
// 1. Do a DFS and store the nodes in a stack according to their finishing time.
// 2. Transpose the graph (reverse the direction of every edge).
// 3. Do DFS on the transposed graph using the order in the stack to identify SCCs.
//
// Input: A directed graph represented as an adjacency list.
// Output: The number of strongly connected components in the graph.

/*
ðŸ§  Logic Recap:
1. First DFS (dfs1) captures the "finish time" ordering of nodes (postorder).
2. Transpose the graph by reversing all edges.
3. Second DFS (dfs2) on the transposed graph using the stack order ensures we explore full SCCs.

âœ… Time Complexity: 
O(V + E), where V = number of vertices, E = number of edges.
- Each node and edge is visited at most twice (once in dfs1, once in dfs2).

âœ… Space Complexity:
O(V + E)
- Adjacency list for graph and transpose: O(V + E)
- Visited array: O(V)
- Stack: O(V)
