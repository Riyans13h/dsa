üìù Question:
You are given a connected, undirected, and weighted graph with V vertices and E edges.
Your task is to find the weight of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's Algorithm.

The graph is represented by an edge list `edges` where:
- edges[i] = {u, v, wt} means there is an undirected edge between u and v with weight wt.

Return:
- The sum of weights of the edges in the MST.

Example:
Input:
V = 3
E = 3
edges = {{0, 1, 5}, {1, 2, 3}, {0, 2, 1}}

Output:
4
Explanation:
The MST will take edges {0,2} (1) and {1,2} (3) ‚Üí total weight = 4

/*
üìå Logic of Prim's Algorithm:
1. Build an adjacency list from the given edge list (undirected graph).
2. Start from any node (we choose node 0 here).
3. Use a min-heap (priority queue) to always pick the smallest edge leading to an unvisited node.
4. Mark the chosen node as visited, and add its edge weight to MST sum.
5. Push all its adjacent edges into the priority queue.
6. Repeat until all vertices are visited.
7. The accumulated sum will be the MST weight.
